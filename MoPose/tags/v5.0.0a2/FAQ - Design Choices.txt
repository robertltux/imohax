Q. Why not use llGetObjectDetails() to fetch the actual avatar position in MultiPose rather than calculating from sit target and having to work around Second Life bug making actual avatar position different than assigned sit target?

A. Can't use that method with anything moving. Doesn't always capture the position correctly depending on moment of sit and lag.

Q. Why not read in a pre-existing 'animations' notecard rather than forcing to have to redo all the adjustments?

A. Simple answer: too lazy and not needed enough. I mean really, it is so easy now to cycle through all the animations and reposition them again that even 40+ animations takes no time.

A. Technical answer: because each adjustment is not in terms of the prim's position but the avatar's itself so that we get the most accurate result when using those adjustments with the MultiPose script. We actually keep two arrays, one of avatar adjustments and one of the poseball adjustments so that the 'go' and 'play' commands work without introducing further error for buggy SL sit target calculation that would otherwise be required with one array of adjustments in only terms of the avatar. This gets particularly complicated when the poseball used for adjustment finding is not the final destination for the animations, MultiPose script, and animations notecard, such as in poseball-less furniture.
