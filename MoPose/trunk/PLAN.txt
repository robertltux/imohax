Mission:
  Create the easiest and best pose/animation tool set that exists by
  factoring popular MoPose functionality and integrating new features
  into scripts and objects targeted at specific users and use cases while
  maximizing OpenSim compatibility and efficiency

Milestones:
* Complete a sit tool, adjustment tool, and multipose script by Christmas
* Complete remote trapeze with 50 animations to work by Jan 2, 2009
* Alpha release MoPose 5.0 by Jan 15th

Design Objectives:
* Safegaurd state against reset, persist state
* Eliminate need to create any configuration by hand
* No unnecessary features per script, minimize logical paths through scripts
* Minimize functions, maximize states, scripts share and override states
* Maximize sustainability, eliminate obfuscation
* Comply strictly with http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Style_Guide
* Comply with BSD licensing for all open source components
* Create help resources to reduce learning curve (video tuts, blogs, pages)
* Animations defined as name, source, adjustment, duration, emote and sound

Functional Requirements:
* One pose, no poseball
* One Pose, poseball
* One Pose (all) syncronized
* Multiple poses, pgup/pgdown
* Multiple poses, menu
* Multiple poses, remote hud
* Multiple poses (all) syncronized
* Emotes independent, but triggered, from pose script
* Wizards for all notecard configurations needed (cutnpaste, email)

Questions:
* Do we add dynamic user adjustment options?
* Do we add dynamic owner adjustment options?
