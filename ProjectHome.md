Compilation of scripts (mostly [LSL)](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal) and content for use in [Second Life](http://secondlife.com) and [OpenSim](http://opensimulator.org). Focus is designed to get beginners creating their own solutions.

I also store any scripts or code used for [blog posts or video tutorials](http://imohax.com) here for reference.

For finished products, mentoring, other services [contact me](http://imohax.com/about).
